### Description

A VB.CommonDialog (ShowOpen & ShowSave) replacement control. Written from scratch - fileview etc., uses only standart vb controls - no listview etc. Take a look at the screenshot! Not saying that it is great (has some issues - slownes on older PC's - but as fast as it can be at given concep), but is certanly worth trying! Probably some bugs, since I didn't have a look at the code for months... But nothing serious... I was developing it for more than 6 months (with testing) - it was a part from another (abandoned) project... Send comments... Voite if you like - this is the only way for me to find out how good (or bad) job did I do;) Download and have fun. PS. Oh, sorry commented, but not very well...But should be readable to intermediate users... And not to forget - some of the code (cmemdc.cls, and some bits of code) are from PSC - do not know if there are coments about the who is the author - so if you recognize your code, write here (put a comment) or email me, and you will be pu here on the list... Thanks!!!
